    "### **Task 4. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, use the results of the models above to formulate a conclusion. Consider the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Would you recommend using this model? Why or why not?**\n",
    "Yes, this is model performs acceptably. Its F1 score was 0.7308 and it had an overall accuracy of 0.7013. It correctly identified ~77% of the actual responders in the test set. It may be worthwhile to test the model with a select group of taxi drivers to get feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What was your model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?**   \n",
    "Unfortunately, random forest is not the most transparent machine learning algorithm. We know that Passenger_count,VendorID, nighttime and daytime are the most important features, but we don't know how they influence tipping. This would require further exploration. It is interesting that VendorID is one of the most predictive feature. This seems to indicate that one of the two vendors tends to attract more generous customers. It may be worth performing statistical tests on the different vendors to examine this further.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are there new features that you can engineer that might improve model performance?**   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What features would you want to have that would likely improve the performance of your model?** \n",
    "It would probably be very helpful to have past tipping behavior for each customer. It would also be valuable to have accurate tip values for customers who pay with cash. It would be helpful to have a lot more data. With enough data, we could create a unique feature for each pickup/dropoff combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, sometimes your data simply will not be predictive of your chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion. Even if you cannot use the model to make strong predictions, was the work done in vain? Consider any insights that you could report back to stakeholders."
