# New-York-Taxi-and-Limousine-Commission

New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered. 

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

Note: This project's dataset was created for pedagogical purposes and may not be indicative of New York City taxi cab riders' behavior.


**Step 1: Inspect and Analyse Data**

**The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process:**

1.Build a dataframe for the TLC dataset

2.Examine data type of each column

3.Gather descriptive statistics


**Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**The purpose** of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis on a provided data set. Your mission is to continue the investigation you began in C2 and perform further EDA on this data with the aim of learning more about the variables. 
  
**The goal** is to clean data set and create a visualization.
