# New-York-Taxi-and-Limousine-Commission

New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered. 

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

Note: This project's dataset was created for pedagogical purposes and may not be indicative of New York City taxi cab riders' behavior.


**Step 1: Inspect and Analyse Data**

**The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process:**

1.Build a dataframe for the TLC dataset

2.Examine data type of each column

3.Gather descriptive statistics


**Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**The purpose** of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis on a provided data set. Your mission is to continue the investigation you began in C2 and perform further EDA on this data with the aim of learning more about the variables. 
  
**The goal** is to clean data set and create a visualization.


**Step 3: Statistical analysis (Hypothesis testing)**

**The purpose** of this project is to demostrate knowledge of how to prepare, create, and analyze A/B tests. Your A/B test results should aim to find ways to generate more revenue for taxi cab drivers.

**Note:** For the purpose of this exercise, assume that the sample data comes from an experiment in which customers are randomly selected and divided into two groups: 1) customers who are required to pay with credit card, 2) customers who are required to pay with cash. Without this assumption, we cannot draw causal conclusions about how payment method affects fare amount.

**The goal** is to apply descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing in Python. The goal for this A/B test is to sample data and analyze whether there is a relationship between payment type and fare amount. For example: discover if customers who use credit cards pay higher fare amounts than customers who use cash.
